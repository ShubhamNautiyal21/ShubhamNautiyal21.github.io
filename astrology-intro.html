				John H. Nelson's Planetary Propagation Theory & the World of Vedic
				Astrology
			</p>
		</header>

		<div class="container">
			<h2>John H. Nelson’s Planetary Propagation Theory</h2>
			<p>
				John H. Nelson’s work is a fascinating blend of astronomy, radio
				science, and planetary theory. He wasn’t researching planets in the
				traditional astrophysical sense—like studying their geology or
				atmospheres—but rather exploring how planetary alignments might
				influence solar activity and, in turn, radio wave propagation on Earth.
			</p>
			<h3>Nelson’s Key Findings</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					In the early 1950s, while working as an engineer for RCA
					Communications, Nelson developed a theory that planetary positions
					relative to the Sun could be used to predict shortwave radio
					propagation conditions.
				</li>
				<li>
					He observed that certain heliocentric angles between
					planets—especially 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°—correlated with degraded
					radio propagation.
				</li>
				<li>
					Angles like 60° and 120°, particularly between Jupiter and Saturn,
					were associated with stable propagation.
				</li>
				<li>
					His predictions were reportedly about 85% accurate based on data from
					1950–1951.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Why RCA Was Interested</h3>
			<p>
				RCA relied heavily on shortwave radio for global communications.
				Magnetic storms—often triggered by solar activity—could disrupt these
				signals. Nelson’s goal was to create a forecasting system for magnetic
				storms using planetary configurations as indicators.
			</p>
			<h3>Legacy and Controversy</h3>
			<p>
				His work was republished in Infinite Energy magazine in 2000, sparking
				renewed interest among amateur radio enthusiasts and alternative science
				communities. Despite its intriguing correlations, Nelson’s theory hasn’t
				gained mainstream scientific acceptance. It’s often viewed as
				speculative, though some researchers still find it worth exploring.
			</p>

				Institute’s reprint here:

			<h2>Astrology: The Cosmic Language</h2>
			<p>
				Astrology interprets planetary movements as symbolic messages connecting
				the macrocosm (universe) with the microcosm (human life). It offers a
				framework for understanding personality, life patterns, and cosmic
				timing.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Planets:</strong> Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter,
					Saturn, plus outer planets for modern charts.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Houses:</strong> Twelve divisions of the sky representing life
					areas such as career, relationships, and health.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Zodiac Signs:</strong> Aries through Pisces, marking the Sun’s
					yearly path.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>The 12 Houses of Astrology: Meaning & Energy</h2>

			<h2>Linking Nelson's Degrees to Astrology</h2>
			<p>
				Nelson focused on planetary angles of 0°, 60°, 90°, 120°, 180°, and
				270°. In astrology, these are key aspects:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>0° (Conjunction):</strong> Planets merge energies—can
					intensify influence.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>60° (Sextile):</strong> Harmonious opportunity and easy flow.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>90° (Square):</strong> Tension, challenge, dynamic growth.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>120° (Trine):</strong> Natural talent, effortless support.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>180° (Opposition):</strong> Balance or conflict between
					polarities.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>270°:</strong> A waning square, signaling internal adjustment.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				These same angular relationships that Nelson linked to radio
				disturbances mirror astrological interpretations of planetary aspects,
				highlighting an intriguing bridge between empirical observation and
				ancient cosmic language.
